## Code Puzzle: Word Search
 
This one’s a variation on word search puzzles. Recall that a word search grid is something like this:

    T H A T X
    H A T X X
    I X H X X
    S X X E X
    O T H E R
 
You’re given a list of words, say: this, that, hat, other, her. The task is to 
find the number of occurrences of each word in the matrix, horizontally, vertically, 
and diagonally. So in the answer, “that” occurs only once, while “hat” and “her” 
both occur a couple of times.


## Code Puzzle: Series of numbers… 1, 2, 3, 4
 
Numbers match up to associated indexes in the alphabet… 1 is A and 2 is B
Figure out all the different letters represented by the input, the digit string
Different combinations of that digit string. Using any language you want… NOT pseudocode
